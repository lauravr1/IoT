## 1. Introduction
The Canine Treat Dispenser Arduino code is designed to control a servo motor that dispenses treats to your dog. This manual provides instructions on how to set up and use the code effectively.
<br>

## 2. Hardware Requirements
To use this code, you will need the following hardware:
<br>
- An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- A servo motor
- A push-button switch
- Jumper wires
- A power supply for the servo (if required)
<br>

## 3. Software Requirements
You will need the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to upload the code to your Arduino board. You can download the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
<br>

## 4. Installation
1. Connect your servo motor to the Arduino. Typically, the servo has three wires: power (red), ground (brown), and control (orange or yellow). Connect the power and ground to the corresponding pins on the Arduino (5V and GND), and the control wire to a digital pin (e.g., pin 9).
2. Connect the push-button switch to your Arduino. Connect one side of the switch to a digital pin (e.g., pin 2) and the other side to GND.
3. Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
4. Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
5. Select the correct Arduino board and COM port from the "Tools" menu.
6. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
<br>

## 5. Usage
7. Power your Arduino board using a USB cable or an external power source.
8. When you press the push-button switch, the servo motor will rotate to dispense a treat. The servo will return to its initial position after a delay.
<br>

## 6. Troubleshooting
- If the servo doesn't move when the button is pressed, double-check your wiring connections and ensure that the servo is powered correctly.
- If the servo behaves erratically, you may need to adjust the servo angles in the code to control the treat dispensing.
<br>

## 7. Customization
You can customize the code by:
- Adjusting the servo angle in the code to control the treat dispensing duration.
- Modifying the delay times to change how long the servo holds the treat dispenser position.
<br>

## 8. Safety Precautions
- Ensure that your hardware connections are secure to prevent accidents.
- Be cautious when using a servo with a mechanical treat dispenser to prevent injury to your dog.
- Keep the Arduino and wires out of your dog's reach to avoid damage.
<br>

## 9. Conclusion
The Canine Treat Dispenser Arduino code is a simple way to control a treat dispenser for your dog. With this code, you can easily reward your pet with treats, enhancing training and playtime. Enjoy using this code to make your dog's day even more enjoyable!
